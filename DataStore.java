    // 1.000.000.000 as base-store)

    // (lookup the ASCII-table)
    // Create the user-dialog for retrieving birthyear, height, weight, initials of name and hometown
    // Make sure all the data will fit into the big number you picked above as base-store. 
    // (create your own location-table, like HER for Herning, CPH for Copenhagen etc)
    // Tool: When user enters a string you must use String.charAt(<position>) to get to
    // each character (ThinkJava p. 93). Scanner does not have a nextChar-method.
    // Organize your code so that you have one method for getting the data from the user and return this as a Long
    // And another for receiving the Long int and do the decomposition of the different parts. 
    // By the end this method should display the user-data with a series of printf-statements.
